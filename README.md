Plotting the Dragon Curve Fractal

The Dragon Curve Fractal is a geometric pattern that is a not-so-obvious result
of a fairly simple idea. It is formed by a line that makes either a left or 
right 90 degree turn at regular intervals. The formula for determining whether 
to turn left or right arises from folding a piece of paper: you begin by taking a strip
of paper and folding it in half by bringing the left end to the right. Once folded 
in half, the process is repeated, again bringing the left end to the right. This process
is repeated over and over again. When the paper is finally unfolded, there will be
a series of creases, some concave and others convex. The form takes shape when the
paper is arranged by making each crease 90 degrees. The true fractal is only created 
after infinite folds, but it takes just a few iterations (n = 8 or 9) to see the
overall form of the fractal.
