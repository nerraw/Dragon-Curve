It is formed by a line that makes either a left or \r\nright 90 degree turn at regular intervals. The formula for determining whether \r\nto turn left or right arises from folding a piece of paper. If you take a strip\r\nof paper and fold it in half by bringing the left end to the right. Once folded \r\nin half, the process is repeated bringing the left end to the right. This process\r\nis repeated over and over again. When the paper is finally unfolded, there will be\r\na series of creases, some concave and others convex. The form takes shape when the\r\npaper is arranged by making each crease 90 degrees. The true fractal is created \r\nafter infinite folds, but it only takes a few iterations (n = 8 or 9) to see the\r\noverall form of the fractal. \r\n\r\nSEE MORE:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCyC-K_PnRY\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NajQEiKFom4\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdyociU35u8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Dragon Curve Python Code](https://github.com/nerraw/nerraw.github.io/blob/master/dragonplot.py)\r\n\r\n![Output of code for n=13](http://i.imgur.com/6D4cFv8.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
